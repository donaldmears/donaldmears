## Hi, I'm Donald Mears 👋
As a highly experienced strategist with a strong background in operations analysis and reporting, I've spent over 20 years in leadership roles at Delta Air Lines, driving continuous improvement through the use of data and analytics. In my most recent role at Delta Community Credit Union, I lead the enterprise strategy team, providing insightful and actionable recommendations to support business decisions. I'm skilled in the use of quantitative analysis through data, data visualization tools, and market studies, and have developed financial models and analysis of trends to inform business decisions.

My very best work is provided for my employer and therefore I've decided to share some "on-the-side curiosity" work I've done in the hope it may be helpful in some way.

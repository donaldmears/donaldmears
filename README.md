## Hi, I'm Donald Mears üëã
Leveraging a strong foundation in data analysis, financial modeling, and strategic thinking, I'm passionate about driving business growth and operational efficiency. With a proven track record in translating complex data into actionable insights, I've successfully supported strategic initiatives and operational improvements for leading organizations like Delta Air Lines and Delta Community Credit Union.

Core Competencies:
‚Ä¢ Data Analysis & Visualization: Proficiency in SQL, Python, and Tableau to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize data.
‚Ä¢ Financial Modeling: Developing and optimizing financial models to inform decision-making and forecasting.
‚Ä¢ Strategic Planning: Collaborating with cross-functional teams to identify opportunities, assess risks, and develop strategic roadmaps.
‚Ä¢ Operational Excellence: Streamlining processes, improving efficiency, and driving continuous improvement.
‚Ä¢ Problem-Solving: A strong analytical mindset to identify root causes and develop innovative solutions.
‚Ä¢ Communication: Effectively communicating complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

I have a lot of work experience that I've provided to my employers, and I'm now sharing some of my personal projects in the hopes that they may be helpful in some way.

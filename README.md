## Hi, I'm Donald Mears üëã
As a highly experienced strategist with a strong background in operations analysis and reporting, I've spent over 20 years in leadership roles at Delta Air Lines, driving continuous improvement through the use of data and analytics. In my most recent role at Delta Community Credit Union, I lead the enterprise strategy team, providing insightful and actionable recommendations to support business decisions. I'm skilled in the use of quantitative analysis through data, data visualization tools, and market studies, and have developed financial models and analysis of trends to inform business decisions.

In addition to my extensive experience in operations analysis and reporting, I'm also deeply passionate about data science and analytics. There's nothing more exciting to me than diving into a dataset, uncovering hidden insights, and turning them into actionable recommendations. I find the process of data wrangling, cleaning, and transforming to be especially rewarding, as it lays the foundation for sound analysis. Exploratory data analysis is another area that I enjoy immensely, as it allows me to use visualization and statistical techniques to understand complex relationships and patterns in the data. And when it comes to building models, I'm always eager to explore new algorithms and techniques that can predict or prescribe outcomes with greater accuracy and efficiency. Whether it's a classification problem, a regression task, or a recommendation system, I approach each challenge with a deep curiosity and a commitment to delivering the best possible results.

My very best work is provided for my employer and therefore I've decided to share some "on-the-side curiosity" work I've done in the hope it may be helpful in some way.

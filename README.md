## Hi, I'm Donald Mears üëã
As a seasoned strategist with extensive experience in operations analysis and reporting, I've led teams and driven improvement initiatives at Delta Air Lines for over two decades. In my most recent role at Delta Community Credit Union, I provided insightful recommendations to support critical business decisions as the leader of the enterprise strategy team. My expertise lies in quantitative analysis, market studies, and financial modeling, which enables me to generate actionable insights from complex data sets.

Beyond my technical skills, I have a deep passion for data science and analytics. I find the process of transforming data into meaningful insights incredibly rewarding, especially when it involves wrangling and cleaning large data sets to create a solid foundation for analysis. Exploratory data analysis is another area I enjoy, as it helps me uncover complex relationships and patterns using statistical techniques and visualizations. When it comes to building models, I'm always eager to explore new algorithms and techniques to improve accuracy and efficiency. Whether it's a classification problem, regression task, or recommendation system, I approach each challenge with curiosity and a commitment to delivering exceptional results.

I have a lot of work experience that I've provided to my employers, and I'm now sharing some of my personal projects in the hopes that they may be helpful in some way.

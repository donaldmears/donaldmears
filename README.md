## Hi, I'm Donald Mears 👋
As a highly experienced strategist with a strong background in operations analysis and reporting, I've spent over 20 years in leadership roles at Delta Air Lines, driving continuous improvement through the use of data and analytics. In my most recent role at Delta Community Credit Union, I lead the enterprise strategy team, providing insightful and actionable recommendations to support business decisions. I'm skilled in the use of quantitative analysis through data, data visualization tools, and market studies, and have developed financial models and analysis of trends to inform business decisions. I'm also passionate about learning, recently completing the IBM Data Science Professional Specialization Program and the Kennesaw State University Leadership Excellence Program.
